Stop bundling with `bunchee` and fall in line with other `@storacha/` packages. This could potentially cause an issue with downstream packages, but it's not expected to. If you have an issue importing `'@storacha/ui-core'` or `'@storacha/ui-react'` as of this version, please file an issue so we can address it!
