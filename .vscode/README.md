# VS Code config

The config here uses the [Workspace Config+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Swellaby.workspace-config-plus) extension to merge checked-in settings with local-only settings. Make sure you have it installed to produce the actual settings file(s).

To use your own local configuration specific to this workspace, create a `settings.local.json`, `tasks.local.json`, or `launch.local.json` file. Workspace Config+ will generate the main file for you.
